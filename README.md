Secure Log Management in The Cloud Service

Cloud computing enables highly scalable services to be easily consumed over the Internet. A major feature of the cloud services is that the users’ data are usually processed remotely in unknown machines that users do not own or operate. The data processed on clouds are often outsourced, leading to a number of issues related to accountability, including the handling of personally identifiable information. While enjoying the convenience brought by this new emerging technology, users’ fears of losing control of their own data can become a significant barrier to the wide adoption of cloud services. To address this problem, a system is proposed that provides secure framework for data sharing in the cloud computing environment. The framework provides an effective mechanism for the users to monitor the usage of their data in the cloud. This approach enables enclosing the logging mechanism together with users’ data and policies. The JAR programmable capabilities is used to ensure that any access to users’ data will trigger authentication and automated logging local to the JARs. To strengthen the user’s control, the framework also provides distributed auditing mechanisms by introducing a novel approach, namely Cloud Information Accountability (CIA) framework, based on the notion of information accountability. Unlike privacy protection technologies which are built on the hide-it-or-lose-it perspective, information accountability focuses on keeping the data usage transparent and traceable.
